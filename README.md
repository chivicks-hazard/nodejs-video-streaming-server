# NodeJS Video Streaming Server

This is a project I used to understand streams, and how they work, especially when sending media data across a network through a server. It is built with NodeJS.

If you want to run the app, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository
2. Add any video of your choice in the `videos` folder
3. Go to line 13 of [index.js](./index.js) and change the value of the video to the name of your video in [`videos`](/videos/)
4. Open a terminal window in the directory of the repository in your PC/laptop/device/machine and run `node index.js`.
5. Go to your browser, copy http://localhost:5000/, paste it in your address bar and hit enter. You are going to see something like the image below
